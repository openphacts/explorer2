== Introduction

Explorer 2 is a complimentary application to the original OpenPHACTS Core GUI (https://github.com/openphacts/coreGUI). It is used to search for chemical compound and target information but using a more web like search interface. Instead of knowing in advance the compound/target you wish to search for this version of the explorer gives you the ability to use free text searching.
